# .pandoc

These are my Pandoc templates.

## Usage

1. Checkout the code somewhere convenient, e.g., `~/src`.
2. Symlink ~/.pandoc to this repository, e.g.: `cd && ln -s src/pandoc-dotfiles .pandoc`

## Notes

I use some pretty esoteric fonts for the pandoc-md-preview template, so you may see fallbacks if they aren't installed on your computer.  Unfortunately I don't think they're safe to redistribute, or I'd include them here.  You may need to edit the CSS in `templates/pandoc-md-preview.html` to use fonts that you like.
